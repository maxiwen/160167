Forever
	I stand alone in the darkness
	The winter of my life came so fast
	Memories go back to childhood 
	to days I still recall
	Oh how happy I was then ?  

	There was no sorrow there was no pain
	Walking through the green fields 
	Sunshine in my eyes  

	I'm still there everywhere 
	I'm the dust in the wind 
	I'm the star in the northern sky
	I never stayed anywhere  
	I'm the wind in the trees 
	Would you wait for me forever?
